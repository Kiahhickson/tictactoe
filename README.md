Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game. 

http://kiahhickson.github.io/tictactoe/

I used the following technologies:

1. Javascript;
2. jQuery;
3. CSS; and
4. HTML.

My initial approach was to get started on how my game will look visually. I began by choosing the visual aspects such as background and font style and then created a table. 

My X and O characters, header image and player titles are png files of the selected font I like.

I would have liked to include an AI component of this game however I struggled to work the logic behind this. I also had ideas for including an event handler onClick to create a sound when a table element was clicked, however I decided this would be annoying and my lack of knowledge and ability to grasp the above concepts most likely dissuaded me from pursuing this further. 

Furthermore, I wanted to add an overlay of a flock of butterflies to impress Joel, but I guess I am just not really impressive.. So Joel missed out this time around.. 

I initially made my game without taking into account any responsiveness and it was a complete mess. I was not happy with this so I took a different approach and re-wrote my code (primarily HTML/CSS aspects) to divide my sections up within 'wrappers' and containers. I also used floats to Joel's dismay, however I now agree with Joel why using floats are a terrible idea (curiosity killed the cat right?).

Both Jack and Joel gave the greatest amount of guidance to my Project 0 - so thanks! 

I made Joel a thank you gif(t)... I hope he likes it.

On reflection - this wasn't too easy for me and I definitely focused more on the HTML/ CSS components on this project. It may not be the best code wise but it is pretty :).

- Kiah.
